#### **Version** Alpha 1.3

_Clicker Clicker is a remake of the Scratch project also entitled [Clicker Clicker](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/404923232/)._

## Introduction
Clicker Clicker is a basic idle game written as a standalone desktop application. Click the main button to get more _Clicks_ for you to spend on upgrades - which, in turn, gives you more _Clicks_; faster than normal.
Clicker Clicker is more of a hobby project rather than a proper game, I'm learning Java and I thought this might be a fun project to make.

## Version
Clicker Clicker is still in the Alpha phase as it has no icons, no sound, and is still missing important features. Beta releases will begin once the core elements are in place and the game works, and all that is left to do will be enhancing performance, graphics, and sounds.

## Installation
You can find the game's versions in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Toydotgame/ClickerClicker/releases/), on there the current version jarfile and the source code will be avaliable.
You will need to have installed the latest version of Java installed. ([Download here](https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=242060_3d5a2bb8f8d4428bbe94aed7ec7ae784))
Once you have downloaded the `.jar` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Toydotgame/ClickerClicker/releases/) tab, and you have Java installed; open the folder with the downloaded `.jar` file in it, and double-click it. Simple! Your game should load in a new window.

## Licsense
I don't know _exactly_ what license fits my needs best, but I've chosen the _GNU AGPLv3_ Licsense for now. Basically, don't mark and distubute this work as your own; unless you've made **_huge_** changes to the game, almost to the point where it's unrecognisable from the original.
