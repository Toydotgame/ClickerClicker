#### Being remade!

_Clicker Clicker is a remake of the Scratch project also titled [Clicker Clicker](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/404923232/)._

## Introduction
Clicker Clicker is a basic idle game written as a standalone desktop application. Click the main button to get more _Clicks_ for you to spend on upgrades!
I'm re-making the original [discontinued] version of Clicker Clicker for school now, as I'm a bit more familiar with Java.

## Installation
You can find the game's versions in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Toydotgame/ClickerClicker/releases/).
###### You will need to have installed the latest version of Java installed. (From [Java.com](https://www.java.com/en/download/))
Once you have downloaded the `.jar` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Toydotgame/ClickerClicker/releases/) tab, and you have Java installed; open the folder with the downloaded `.jar` file in it, and double-click it.
